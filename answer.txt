Answer 1:
In test3, we observe bouncing while the initial packet (src 0 dst 4) gets forwarded back and forth between router 1 and 2. After some time, the routes converge and the packet is successfully routed to router 4.
Later (time 45), the network gets partitioned by taking down a link, and the packet (sent at time 50) is forwarded back and forth until the metrics reach infinity, when the packet is dropped.
In test4, we observe counting to infinity again, after which the packet is dropped

Answer 2:
In test3, enabling poison reverse prevents the problems mentioned earlier.
In test4, however, once the network is partitioned, there is still a loop that counts to infinity due to the timing of the routing table updates.
